=head1 NAME

Data::Token - Generate an unpredictable unique token

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Data::Token version 0.0.3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Data::Token;
	print token;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library exports a single method 'token' which can be used to generate a
unique and unpredictable token.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 token

Return a unique token.

=head1 DATA

The data returned may change over time, but will be kept to characters between
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - and a maximum length of 256 characters (currently it is
much shorter).

It is safe to put in a URL (note: Length may become an issue in the future);
insert into a database (although you should always use BIND columns); as an
attribute or text section of XML (also HTML) (but not as a Tag name); store
as a filename on disk; key/value in a Hash etc.

=head1 SECURITY

These tokens are hard to guess. That does not mean there are no overlaps.
Using a hashing system such as MD5 or SHA-1 still means possibility of overlap.
MD5 is a problem in signatures against large documents
because you can change parts of the document without changing the meaning.
But this system is only using MD5
to hide the secret and add unpredictability. So MD5 or SHA-1 - Jury is out.

=head2 Duplicates

You should check for duplicates in your local store before returning. The
chances of duplicates are extremely unlikely but better safe than sorry.

=head2 Brute force attack

Although the numbers are unpredictable there is alwas brute force attacks.
These need to be guarded against. A system should increase the time delay on
requests as the attack increases. If you are using Apache this can be done with
other modules, or integrated into your solution.

=head1 INTEGRATION

This module is written to replace embedded modules in applications such as
CGI::Session, but also for non-standard modules you have to write yourself
(e.g. Creating a unique URL for returning private data).

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Data::Token requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Uses Data::UUID to create the initial unique number and md5 to generate the
unpredictability.

XXX Possibly SHA1 and Crypt::Random

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.
